{"name":"Srvk.GitHub.io","tagline":"The Speech Recognition Virtual Kitchen","body":"### Welcome to the Speech Recognition Virtual Kitchen!\r\n\r\nThe Speech Recognition Virtual Kitchen is dedicated to improving community research and education infrastructure in speech recognition. The \"kitchen\" environment hosts Virtual Machines (VMs) that provide a consistent environment for experimentation. We liken the VMs to a \"kitchen\" because they provide the infrastructure into which one can install \"appliances\" (e.g., speech recognition toolkits), \"recipes\" (scripts for creating state-of-the art systems), and \"ingredients\" (language data). The kitchen provides fully configured VMs with documented baselines, so that you can start experimenting right away, without having to download, configure, compile, verify, update, recompile, etc. \"stuff\".\r\n\r\nThe Speech Kitchen can be used in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Download and run a Virtual Machine directly on your computer using [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org) or [VMWare](http://www.vmware.com). This is like a computer within your computer.\r\n* Run one of our open-sourced images on [Amazon EC2](https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-1#Images:visibility=public-images;search=speech%20recognition;sort=name).\r\n* Check out our repository on Github, and build the VM yourself using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com). A smaller download and you can easily change the configuration of your VM and re-create it. Here be dragons!\r\n\r\nIf you have something that you would like to **contribute and share with others** - please [drop us a line](http://speechkitchen.org/?page_id=150#emailJumpBookmark)! We'll be happy to re-distribute (in fact, we do not have resources to develop a lot of stuff ourselves).\r\n\r\n### The Speech Kitchen Website\r\n\r\nOur main web-site with lots of documentation and downloads of several ready-made Virtual Machines can be found at [http://speechkitchen.org](http://speechkitchen.org).\r\n\r\n### The Speech Kitchen Repository\r\n\r\nRight here on [Github](https://github.com/srvk), including a [Wiki](https://github.com/srvk/srvk.github.io/wiki). Here be dragons.\r\n\r\n### Contact us\r\n\r\nYou can reach us [here](http://speechkitchen.org/home/contact/).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nThe Speech Recognition Virtual Kitchen is supported by NSF Grant Nos. CNS-1205589, IIS-1247368, CNS-1305319, & CNS-1205424.\r\n\r\n![NSF](http://speechkitchen.org/icon/nsf.jpg)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
